Program used for experimental study of (i) international business, specially "money zombies"*, (ii) marketing, specially branding, (iii) information networking through the use of tender, and (iv) information asymmetry in decision making (business) and risk-taking. Can also be modified to study infectious sickness spreads in medicine.

*"Money zombies" are individuals that are susceptible to other individuals' influence due to a significant amount of resources provided to the recipient individual. As the most widely observable scenario, 'money zombies' persistently operate against their home nation's interests in favor of a foreign nation that has provided the 'money zombie' with a significant amount of resources.
